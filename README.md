## The challenge

The challenge was to first come up with a modern and sleek design and then build a responsive website that would display information regarding provided services, recent projects, a live Instagram feed etc. He also requested the functionality to make changes to certain content himself after project handover.


## The result

A responsive Angular application was created based on a design mockup which encompasses a user and an admin space. The user space shows static information like services, contact information etc. as well as dynamic information like projects and an Instagram feed. The dynamic information is controlled via the admin space which is login-locked and provides an easy-to-use interface to create, edit and delete information by Tomke himself.
